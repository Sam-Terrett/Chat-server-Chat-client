# Chat-server-Chat-client
The chat server can be run on one machine, and multiple chat clients can join and talk to eachother.

This was a project I did in my first year of my Computer Science course. 
The files in ChatServer must be compiled together and ran on a host machine.
Then the ChatClient can be compiled and ran on any other machine and connect to the host in order to chat to eachother.

These programs are a demonstration of using sockets and connections within Java along with using and handling multiple threads.
